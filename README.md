# Advanced Programming - Spring 2024

This repository contains the computer assignments and project materials for the **Advanced Programming** course offered in Spring 2024.

## Computer Assignments

### CA0: Train Ticket Recommendation System
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with input/output operations using the `iostream` library, and to learn how to test programs following the course standards. Students will implement a train ticket recommendation system where users can find suitable trains based on origin and destination.

### CA1: Course Selection System
This assignment introduces students to string and vector manipulation. You will design a simplified version of a university course registration system.

### CA2: Recursive Programming Challenges
This assignment focuses on recursive programming and includes three separate problems. Students are required to solve all questions using recursion, even if iterative solutions are possible. Special attention should be paid to the final question, which involves recursive backtracking, though loops may be used in other parts of the solution.

### CA3: Top-Down Design
In this task, students practice designing a problem solution in a top-down manner, breaking the problem into manageable sub-components.

### CA4: Object-Oriented Design
This assignment covers the basics of object-oriented programming and how to use these concepts to design software. A solid understanding of OOP is necessary for later assignments in the course, and students are encouraged to dedicate enough time to master the concepts.

### CA5: Event-Driven OOP and GUI Programming
This assignment introduces event-driven programming using object-oriented principles alongside graphical libraries. Students are expected to apply the programming techniques they have learned in previous assignments. The final application will be a **Plants vs. Zombies**-style game developed using the **SFML** graphical library. It is strongly recommended to build and test the project incrementally.

### CA6: Final Project - University Management System
The final project integrates all previously learned skills. Students are required to develop a university management system that supports course creation and offering, post sharing, student-faculty communication, announcements, and course registration. The project should be built iteratively, starting with a general structure and gradually incorporating more features.
